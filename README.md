## Notes
All aspects of the code were written by me (Chris Yong Hong Sen). Special thanks to Hilmie Hilmie Ahmad Khalil Lajan for joining in the discussion of the statistical methodology in model reduction for this social sciences experiment regarding hawker centers. Credit for literature review goes to Sabrina Shahidan, and the rest of the essay were completed by all three of us.
